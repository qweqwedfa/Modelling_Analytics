\section*{Objective Function}

The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost. The total cost consists of two parts:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The transportation cost from production centers to warehouses:
    \[
    \text{Cost}_{\text{Production to Warehouse}} = \sum_{i \in \text{Production Centers}} \sum_{j \in \text{Warehouses}} C_{ij} \cdot X_1^{ij}
    \]
    where \( C_{ij} \) is the cost of transporting from production center \( i \) to warehouse \( j \), and \( X_1^{ij} \) is the decision variable representing the amount of goods transported from production center \( i \) to warehouse \( j \).

    \item The transportation cost from warehouses to distribution centers:
    \[
    \text{Cost}_{\text{Warehouse to Distribution Center}} = \sum_{i \in \text{Warehouses}} \sum_{k \in \text{Distribution Centers}} D_{ik} \cdot X_2^{ik}
    \]
    where \( D_{ik} \) is the cost of transporting from warehouse \( i \) to distribution center \( k \), and \( X_2^{ik} \) is the decision variable representing the amount of goods transported from warehouse \( i \) to distribution center \( k \).
\end{itemize}

The objective function is the sum of both costs:
\[
\text{Minimize } Z = \sum_{i \in \text{Production Centers}} \sum_{j \in \text{Warehouses}} C_{ij} \cdot X_1^{ij} + \sum_{i \in \text{Warehouses}} \sum_{k \in \text{Distribution Centers}} D_{ik} \cdot X_2^{ik}
\]

\section*{Constraints}

\subsection*{Flow Balance at Warehouses}
For each warehouse \( j \), the amount of goods coming into the warehouse must equal the amount of goods going out. This is expressed as:
\[
\sum_{i \in \text{Production Centers}} X_1^{ij} = \sum_{k \in \text{Distribution Centers}} X_2^{jk} \quad \forall j \in \text{Warehouses}
\]

\subsection*{Supply at Production Centers}
The total amount of goods sent from each production center must equal its supply. If the supply at production center \( i \) is \( S_i \), then:
\[
\sum_{j \in \text{Warehouses}} X_1^{ij} = S_i \quad \forall i \in \text{Production Centers}
\]

\subsection*{Demand at Distribution Centers}
The total amount of goods received by each distribution center must equal its demand. If the demand at distribution center \( k \) is \( D_k \), then:
\[
\sum_{i \in \text{Warehouses}} X_2^{ik} = D_k \quad \forall k \in \text{Distribution Centers}
\]
